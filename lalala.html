I could snap my fingers 
Whilst making smoke rings in the air
Closing my eyes,
With the circle ghosts in the 
Smoke,
Living nostalgic
And 
I am still in utter disbelief,
How are we supposed to set apart
Like rains from the cloud,
I want to shout,
But the passage of my words 
Are in a curfew,
And it got vaporized.

But for the past time,
A jerk of happiness flowing through my veins,
Unshaped
Like the sand in the desert,
The air I am exhaling is full of love,
For the past time
Whilst the sunrays hopping up and down,
Turning shades to heat,
Heat to love,
Love to memories,
Memories to vapour.

I am sitting near the window,
Watching the bench below the street lights,
That does not give any light 
It had a thing like bright face glowing in dark,
Having a slideshow in my fore brain,
There was nothing visible,
Still I had a sight,
And for instance
I want to keep it close
hold it tight.

All the sight out there had a
Blurred image of the 
Emanation from my childhood,
I not often meet with those,
As if it gets diffused mysteriously in crowded street,
I gazed abstractedly,
Out of the windows 
Looking for a shadow in darkness
As the light was not bright.

I thought I could get inside it,
But I was already inside the moment,
The window through which the smoke rings vanished ,
Was the depth 
And not the moment,
My brain that was frozen,
Stuck in time.
For an eternity
In heart of crystal
As if time was passing,
But I got a portal through happiness,
Was like listening to lullabies.

Whilst the tunes of days passing by 
Swaying in my head,
And I have been perfectly content,
As if the endless rains in the monsoon,
Inexhaustible 
So as to remain for thousands of years

Stop the tickling of the clock
Live for a moment and 
Not survive for an eternity,
Relish the profound memories
Coming for a hundredth of second
In hope to mend the timeline,
Stop myself doing the snap 
Watching the clouds full of water
Shrouded by the relics from past,
In the heart of fire
Full of betrayal,
For,
The moment betrayed me
In an attempt to revive,
All it did was hurt.

I now want to stop the tick tock of clock
So as to stop all the day dreams 
And the nightmares,
Empty my brain,
For,
Only the moment
I am living now remains.
And again I wish,
Tick tock,
Time stops.`

        text: `Someone once told me about the village at the end of the world,
Where mountains wore snow hats and 
Water in the river is like mirror.

An old dusty mud house stood in middle of the forest which had pine trees which often shivered on cold October evenings.

Who had no one but one friend, 
Whom he lost in the attacks for good.
He started counting the days for the world to end.

But nothing changed,
Life was going on the same steady speed,
He would sit on the porch 
Under the starlit sky,
Missing his days with grandpaa.

Untill he spotted a shooting star,
And as his dadi said,
Ask for wishes when seeing a falling star.
He mumbled"i want to meet him one day".

And the star couldn't take the weight of it all,
And it stumbled down from the sky,
Falling on the man's backyard
Flickering and losing light.

He didn't have a split thought,
He took the star in his palm,
And buried it under the ground.
And watered it for 10 days,untill he saw a tiny sprout coming up.... That night,
He went to sleep early,
Taking his sleeping pills,
Whilst that,
The tree grew from the ground disappearing into the clouds.

And next morning when he woke up,
He could not believe his eyes,
As he could no longer see the top of the tree,
And within that time he saw his grandpa coming down, smiling.
As if the tree were a stairway.`

I used to tell Stories and fairytales to the moon and constellations,
Stories of fire to the Orion,
Love stories and tragedies to Ursa major
About Gods and sports to Cygnus,
And many more.
With innocence and sometimes a heavy heart.

Just with the bit of trauma hidden 
Inside myself,
And a feeling of loss
On the cloudy nights 
For,
I didn't have the listeners to my stories.

Amidst the happy stories you helped me write on the sand and you wrote in the sky,
Like a fairy tale,
Happily.

The gifts stars left for the every 10th hour,
Just to disappear as if I don't need him.
Sometimes I make stories of stars
Like,
The ones I etched on the sand.
Which made the pathways for the serpents,
Home to me.

A few days back,
I replaced them
For the very first time and tied it to the windows of my house,
Like the thousands of shimmering Cresent moons over Jupiter,
And 
Making my window the pavement of stories.

And tonight when I untie,
all the moons reach you,
And Whistle it to you,
And tell that
A child down the road
Draws clouds in the sand.

What if even the moon's lost the path,
And went where those harp lullabies reside,
And for the first time
Sing it to a void.

And then autoplay stories along with my lullabies,
And 
Erase and draw the clouds again,
Reshaping it.

I know my lullabies and your letters live on their own 
Two parallel line,
That would probably never meet,
Except for a glitch in the arrow of time.

Both like the sun,
Undisputed object towering,
But not to be held directly.

All the possibilities denied and the hopes shattered,
And to grieve for the thing I didn't knew even existed.

But still I hoped it did,
In my half remembered dreams,
There rays are my hopes and the void is my scar.

I told my secrets to the moon,
So that it tells those to the stars.

My dreams now suffused in water
With the particles of sand,
And detached sorrow,
With the moaning of the wounded.

With the gravity blunting the 
Edge of those sharp hope,
And now the details of the imaginary stories would slip from the minds grip.

And as those stories fall down,
Like snow from the roof,
And I feel a bit less numb,
As the snow lets me recall all those stories again.`

        text: `Banaras was a place very close to my heart.
I never have been to Banaras, but somehow or the other it feels pleasing and there's a sense of belongingness with a tinge of sadness when it comes about that place.

When I was 12, a day 
Baba, Mumma, Me and Di were walking on the road as it was Saturday then.
On Saturdays, Baba is a bit free and relaxed, so we forced him to come for a walk. Mumma made that happen.
I was holding Mumma’s hand & Di was holding Baba’s.
Then I saw a star-shaped stone on the road and I started crying because, for me stars were always precious as I believed it was Dadaji’s.
Even baba made me believe it.
So, when I started to cry,
Di left Baba’s hand and came to me, held my hands and took me back home.
Whilst that, Baba and Mumma also followed Di.
While we reached home, I was crying and so Di made me sleep holding my hands.
Then, She told me a story,
A story related to Banaras and Dadaji which I remember like a half dream.

When baba was 10, Dadaji and Baba went to Banaras'
every year on the start of spring
Baba and Dadaji used to travel in month of March.
Dadaji liked taking Baba to places,
Telling him stories about how it came into being,
And baba listened to all of those,
While dadaji held his hands and walked down the road.... Dadaji once told about the boatman that lived in the ghats of Banaras, 
And how his life was.
Baba don’t remember much about that incident as he was only 10.
But Baba remembered,
The boatman always used to say, “When the world stops, the stories proceed,
And when the rain stops the boat sails.”

This is exact words of the story which Dadaji told
And then Baba, at that time couldn't understand what it meant.
As for baba the world was in the hands of Dadaji,
But Baba didn't question as Dadaji used to say once you are my age, you will understand.
So they both again proceeded to next piece of stories which it included of Priest,
A Beggar , a Cobbler 
And many more from the trip of Banaras where Dadaji and Baba were for 12 days.

5th march to 16th march 

Now when Baba remembers those
days, his eyes fill with tear's and Baba
also doesn't have Dadaji.
And the last trip, they had was to
Banaras as after that Dadaji fell ill
And then he became a Star
And
That is why Baba loved stars too.
When Dadaji died,
Baba took a star shaped stone and
took it together whenever & wherever
he went.
He even told me about this when I
was 8.
So when I saw the stone, I cried.
But I had Di with me,
to help me sleep.
But as Dadaji went,
Di will too.
This is what I thought when I was 10.
But Di's touch made me forget the
negative thoughts at that time,
And again
That happened and Di was there
And so I could again sleep well.
But now neither do I have Di,
Nor do I have Baba,
Nor do I have Dadaji.
But all of them are my star-shaped
stones,
Always in my heart and at the back of
my almirah,
Where my heart is
And hence even in cloudy nights
when there are no stars, I have 3
stars with me.
And again the Boatman's word
echoed
"When the world stops, the stories
proceed."
As for me when I lost all of them the
world stopped.
But then again the story of mine and
theirs which will forever proceed!`

But there are few I remember,
But the one which is exactly close to my heart is the one which baba told me when I was 8 this was the first time I saw tear in the eye's of baba and as he terms it definitely was his last,
He regretted not telling me stories,
Few of his father told.
But I do remember of when I was fond of gifts,
Any of those,
small pot from lakha's shop would do the trick,
And since I was very fond of them,
Tear in my eyes meant a gift for me.
Which degraded it's real worth.
It was as valuable as glimmer of sunshine on a already hot summer day,
eventually the perpetual arrival of gifts reduced,
And soon vanished from my closet,
Whilst that
I went to Kerela once,
I met a person who used to give free gifts to children,
And I was one of them
But till then my enthusiasm for gifts reduced 
Due to which I never opened it,
But Baba says, always value things you recieve from others,
So I kept it in my wardrobe,
With the antiques of Kerela's hand woven thread,
the shines of paper like  Indian Ocean.
After few years,
In kolkata I remember Karim chacha,
Whose auto was my way to work and back,
Once he said that,
He is from Kerela,
Which is the part I got intrigued with,
I asked more,
He told, his father (Babban) was a clerk at a government office,
But every year on 25th December he used to give gifts.
The winter part of the year,
Implies holidays.
But this year there was a lot of work,
And hustle bustle in the town so Karim chacha was working,
so was I.
25th December arrived and Santa too,
I told Karim chacha that I don't believe in Santa,
And at that same instant someone knocked the taxi,
Dressed in red and white,
He was a Santa.

While Karim chacha told about his father I didn't notice that the Santa in the car got off,
But he left the same box as I recieved while in Kerela,
And as soon as I opened it I saw a letter from Baba himself,
About the gift he arranged for me,
So I took a leave,
Went home,
And opened the box which was a part of my wardrobe for 2 decades
And all I saw was my favourite piece of blue cap, 
I really wanted as a child.
I felt my eyes wet,
So I looked up at the night sky,
Because I still believe that dead people become stars,
And wanted to see baba in the sky!`

But they make things of their own,
I, as a child, was very naive,
And was attached to few things
particularly stars,
I believed dadaji is there amongst those billions of stars(i still do)
I hate rainy season.
As i couldn't see stars and hence couldn't see grandpa.
Once we were going to coimbatore and i believed if we go then I'll lose my relation with those stars which i drew on my notebook and assumed those to be grandpa,
And so I did not go!

Baba always tells about magic, how he was soo attached to magic,
But i never believed him. I always said there is nothing like magic because i heard it in a cartoon!
But still,
One day while walking from temple to home gazing at the stars,
I held baba's hand and asked him whether earth is the greatest magician,
And when he held my hand more stiffly, i thought
I asked something that isn't meant to be.
But as soon as we reached home,
He opened a very old box of dadaji and took out a cap,
And told me a story,
“Story of a gift”
And by that time I saw tears in his eyes for the first time.
With sobby voice, he told me that he regretted not telling me stories that his father told him,
But that tears falling his from cheeks
As he said
Which degraded it's worth,
It was as precious as a ray of sunshine on an already got summer day.
He stopped telling and went back to the room!
We didn't had a conversation about it for a long time,
One day while walking back home 
Baba slipped his hand into mine and said,
Yes the earth is the greatest magician ever,
While we are the audience,
And his greatest trick is making us believe there's a horizon,
The horizon which never ends just like life,
Because people die their memories don't.
Baba knelt down and said, “for me you are a memory of your grandpa!”
I didn't want to leave Baba's hand that day!
But baba did leave my hand,
And went, 
To the place where grandpa is.
I have traced both the stars now!
Baba and grandpa both left,
But they are still there,
In my palms,
As they are memories and memories don't die!... So now even rainy season doesn't affect because the star faded,
It was a death of a star,
But it now is a memory!`

But these are things Baba told we could do nothing about,
When i first saw lakha,I was just 11 and Di was 21,
Jokingly she said,
You know how you see me everyday just live we saw lakha,
And like him i would too disappear,
And all you could do would be, remember.
I stared her with anger,
But didn't express it,
I said Di,
It would be like the body is there but the heartbeat isn't,
I came and told baba,
Di is saying illogical things,
And told him what she said,
He said 'don't think much about it, you are way too small for it'.
I was pretty exasperated by this.
Because it was baba's thing,
To not tell me many things,
And I ignored this,
But my subconscious didn't,
The same day I dreamed,
That when i woke up, there would be no tinge of her,
Just like in midst of the going away thoughts of di,
I forgot Lakha,
Would the same happen to Di,
In hustle bustle of the busy streets of ghazipur.
But i forgot these too,
One day when we were walking in the corridors of Kabir street,
I saw a pot which had a tinge of lakha's work,
I told Di,
He grasped my hand, and didn't let me go to check,
I was so small that i thought,
I could do the same with her and not let her go.
And so I holded her hand ever more tightly,
And she laughed,
I still don't know why,
Maybe she sensed the fear in me.
And days passed since that,
The days were not hard,
But the nights where i couldn't see or talk to her,
Were the hardest.
I felt like everynight i felt like drowning into water,
Just to find di,
And all I could do was pray,
And my messages reach her.
She know what it was there in my mind,
As all inside my heart were you di.
All I imagined was two diverging roads,
That eventually would never meet.
Or like the wind blowing the leaves apart,
Still root holding it strong,
It was like i am unable to explain where it hurts,
But it does.
And one day,
I heard the laughter of you again,
Didn't know it was coming from my mind itself,
But this time no one was there to stop me from not letting me not come to you,
But i still didn't,
And even though the lines of memories of ours didn't began to blur,
I was all transparent.
And that's what matter di,
And so i know,
You were like the intricate designs of Lakha,
Which would never fade from my mind.`
